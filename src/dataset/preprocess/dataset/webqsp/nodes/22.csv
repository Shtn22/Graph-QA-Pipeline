18,"it is impossible for capitalism to survive, primarily because the system of capitalism needs some blood to suck. capitalism used to be like an eagle, but now it's more like a vulture. it used to be strong enough to go and suck anybody's blood whether they were strong or not. but now it has become more cowardly, like the vulture, and it can only suck the blood of the helpless. as the nations of the world free themselves, the capitalism has less victims, less to suck, and it becomes weaker and weaker. it's only a matter of time in my opinion before it will collapse completely."
