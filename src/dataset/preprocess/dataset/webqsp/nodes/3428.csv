164,"“the act of writing itself is much like the construction of a mirror made of words. looking at certain illuminated corners of or cracks within the mirror, the author can see fragments of an objective reality that comprise the physical universe, social communities, political dynamics, and other facets of human existence. looking in certain other corners of the same mirror, he or she may experience glimpses of a true self sheltered deftly behind a mask of public proprieties.”"
