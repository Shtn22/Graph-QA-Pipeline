297,occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. their meaning can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart. such is the moment i am presently experiencing. i experience this high and joyous moment not for myself alone but for those devotees of nonviolence who have moved so courageously against the ramparts of racial injustice and who in the process have acquired a new estimate of their own human worth. many of them are young and cultured. others are middle aged and middle class. the majority are poor and untutored. but they are all united in the quiet conviction that it is better to suffer in dignity than to accept segregation in humiliation. these are the real heroes of the freedom struggle: they are the noble people for whom i accept the nobel peace prize.

1381,"the ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. through violence you may murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. in fact, violence merely increases hate. so it goes. returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."
