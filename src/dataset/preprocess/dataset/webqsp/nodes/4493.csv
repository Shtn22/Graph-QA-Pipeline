2,"einstein's theory was revolutionary because previously scientists had believed that basic quantities of measurement such as time, mass, and length were absolute and unchanging, while his work established the opposite notion - that these measurements could change, depending on the relative motion of the observer."
3,"the magnitude of these effects is negligible at ordinary velocities, for which newton's laws still held good, but at velocities approaching the speed of light they become significant."

157,"during the war years, einstein became an outspoken opponent of german militarism, but remained primarily engaged in perfecting the extension of his 1905 theory of relativity to a broader context, by considering systems that are not in uniform motion but under acceleration."
158,"now attempting to encompass all kinds of motion and accelerations (varying velocities), einstein introduced the concept that it is not possible to distinguish being in a uniform gravitational field from moving under constant acceleration without gravitation and that therefore, in a general view of relativity, gravitation must be taken into account."

298,"from these two assumptions, einstein showed that the length and mass of an object are dependent upon their movement relative to an observer, and derived a mathematical relationship between the length of an object and its velocity (i.e. length would be observed to decrease with increased velocity) as had previously been suggested by lorentz and fitzgerald."

608,"einstein's hypothesis and accompanying mathematical formula, which has become known as einstein's photoelectric law, were confirmed by several experiments, laid the practical foundation for the fields of quantum physics and quantitative photoelectric chemistry, and got him the 1921 nobel prize in physics."

651,"two years later, in 1907, he went on to show that mass is related to energy by the famous equation e=mc2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared), which indicates the enormous amount of energy that is stored as mass, some of which is released in radioactivity and nuclear reactions."
