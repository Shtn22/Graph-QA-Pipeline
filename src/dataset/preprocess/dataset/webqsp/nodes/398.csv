1254,"in his address, entitled \""the american scholar\"", emerson demanded independence from all literatures of the past, from all traditions that had become embalmed in piety and passed for respectable opinion instead of honest thinking\"".  the day after the lecture, a group of supporters  met at emerson's house and formed a society known as the transcendental club. between 1837 and 1838, emerson met a neighbor, the radical thinker, thoreau, a young harvard graduate who had resigned his teaching job because he refused to whip his students. they became good friends and took long walks together. in 1838, emerson delivered  \""an address at divinity college\"" at harvard in which he strongly attacked established religion and accused the unitarian clergy of preaching a \""secondary faith\"", not the primary one based on personal experience of \""one's own indwelling supreme spirit\""  the lecture caused such a scandal at strongly-unitarian harvard that emerson did not return to harvard for 30 years. the transcendentalists, of whom emerson had become major spokesman, found a focus when emerson backed the launch of the \""dial\"", a magazine for new thinking.  in 1841, emerson published a collection of lectures, \""essays: first series\"", and, in 1844  \""essays: second series\"". in the first volume,  emerson consolidated his thoughts on moral individualism and preached the ethics of self-reliance, the duty of self-cultivation, and the need for the expression of self.  in the second volume, emerson accommodated his earlier idealism to the limitations of real life. these two works gave emerson a firm reputation abroad. in 1847-48 he lectured in england and scotland.  in 1850, he published \""representative men\"", a collection of essays on greek philosopher plato, german poet goethe and swedish philosopher swedenborg, and others. in 1856, he published \""english traits\"", based on the lectures he had given in the early 1850s.  in them, he voiced the unease he had felt in england in 1848 when \""his conscience was disturbed by the evidences of inherited privilege, blind conservatism, stupid resistance to ideas, and colossal self-satisfaction\"". in 1851, emerson spoke out against slavery in concord, and, in 1852, delivered his \""conduct of life\"" series of lectures on property, wealth, culture and worship, and in which he made clear that all old forms of religion were in decay.  carlyle thought \""conduct of life\"" emerson's best work. in 1854,  emerson spoke out again against slavery in the new york city tabernacle. in 1860, he published \""the conduct of life\"" lectures."
