634,"the most important aspect of the bohr liquid-drop model was its later ability to explain the process of nuclear fission (the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two parts, almost equal in mass, following the absorption of a neutron, with the release of a tremendous amount of nuclear energy), discovered in 1938 by otto hahn,  fritz strassmann and lise meitner."
635,the liquid-drop model was vindicated when bohr correctly predicted that the differing behavior of the nuclei of uranium-235 and uranium-238 was due to the fact that the number of neutrons in each nucleus was odd and even respectively.
636,"after the war, bohr, like many other manhattan researchers -- most notably oppenheimer (but in direct conflict with fellow nuclear physicist edward teller) -- became activists in trying to keep atomic weapons out of the control of the military and under close civilian supervision."

1283,"in the winter of 1925-26, six months after wiener had lectured at gottingen, born visited the massachusetts institute of technology as a guest lecturer and began a highly productive collaboration with wiener, who returned to work at gottingen in the summer of 1926."

1319,"he and his team were able to measure the height of the reflecting ionized layer and they discovered two more layers: the so-called appleton, or f layer (at more than twice the height of the kennelly-heaviside, or e layer) and the d layer, below e.  they also demonstrated that the reflected wave was elliptically polarized and were able to describe its daily and seasonal variations, and to supply data for mathematical analysis of reflection and density."
1320,"in the results he published in early 1895, wilson indicated that two different kinds of clouds could be produced in dust-free air by different degrees of expansion, corresponding to two different types of nuclei."
1321,wilson's results led him to believe that the production of ions in dust- free air likely was due to radiation from sources outside the atmosphere.
