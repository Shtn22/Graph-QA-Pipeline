150,"the constitution supposes, what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the executive is the branch of power most interested in war, & most prone to it. it has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the legislature. but the doctrines lately advanced strike at the root of all these provisions, and will deposit the peace of the country in that department which the constitution distrusts as most ready without cause to renounce it. for if the opinion of the president not the facts & proofs themselves are to sway the judgment of congress, in declaring war, and if the president in the recess of congress create a foreign mission, appoint the minister, & negociate a war treaty, without the possibility of a check even from the senate, untill the measures present alternatives overruling the freedom of its judgment; if again a treaty when made obliges the legislature to declare war contrary to its judgment, and in pursuance of the same doctrine, a law declaring war, imposes a like moral obligation, to grant the requisite supplies until it be formally repealed with the consent of the president & senate, it is evident that the people are cheated out of the best ingredients in their government, the safeguards of peace which is the greatest of their blessings."

1003,"the genius of republican liberty, seems to demand on one side, not only that all power should be derived from the people; but, that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people, by a short duration of their appointments; and, that, even during this short period, the trust should be placed not in a few, but in a number of hands. stability, on the contrary, requires, that the hands, in which power is lodged, should continue for a length of time, the same. a frequent change of men will result from a frequent return of electors, and a frequent change of measures, from a frequent change of men; whilst energy in government requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it by a single hand."
