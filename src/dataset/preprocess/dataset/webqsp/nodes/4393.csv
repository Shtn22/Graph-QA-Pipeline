388,many younger musicians undervalued armstrong in his last years because his contributions pervaded the music so deeply that many did not recognize him as their originator.
389,"after the second world war, armstrong fronted a smaller group, the 'all stars.' while he continued to be seen as a popular entertainer and occasional movie-player, he contributed great instrumental performances right through into the 60s, when he began to appear more often only as a singer."
