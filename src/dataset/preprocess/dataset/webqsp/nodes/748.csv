1,"it is not clear whether this trip precipitated the ultimate crisis, but in march 1616 a committee of consultors to the holy office declared that the proposition that the sun is the immovable centre of the universe was heretical, and that the proposition of a moving earth was theologically \""erroneous\""."

126,"influenced by regiomontanus' correction of an  error in ptolemy's astronomical system (unquestioned for over 1,300 years) copernicus went on to lay the foundations of modern astronomy."

130,"according to ptolemy, this model provided the basis for mathematical computations that would explain all the strange things astronomers observed, such as the way the brightness of the planets waxed and waned, and the way in which they appeared to stop moving, or go backwards and forwards in a loop (like mars)."
131,the speed of the planetary movements also seemed to vary and ptolemy dealt with this anomaly by creating an imaginary point in the sky called the 'equant' from where the speed could be seen to be steady and circular.
