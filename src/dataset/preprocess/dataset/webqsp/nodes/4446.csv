15,"at the protestant university of tÿbingen  kepler studied theology, philosophy, and mathematics (under the astronomer maestlin, who introduced him to copernicus' work.   kepler intended to become a lutheran minister, and after graduating in 1591, started a three-year programme of theological training. kepler's theological studies were interrupted in 1594, when he was nominated by his tutors for a teaching post in mathematics and astronomy at the academy in graz (now in austria)  where he stayed for four years, and began to concentrate on both astrology (he remained a believer in astrology until his death) and astronomy, working with maestlin on optics and planetary orbits."
16,"in the 1543: \""on the revolutions of the celestial spheres\"", copernicus put forward a view of the universe that provided a new basis for making the mathematical calculations needed to provide accurate information for calendar reform, to predict astronomical events like eclipses,  and to investigate the cosmos."
17,"he stated that the sun, not the earth, was the fixed point in the centre of the universe."

177,"according to ptolemy, this model provided the basis for mathematical computations that would explain all the strange things astronomers observed, such as the way the brightness of the planets waxed and waned, and the way in which they appeared to stop moving, or go backwards and forwards in a loop (like mars)."
178,the speed of the planetary movements also seemed to vary and ptolemy dealt with this anomaly by creating an imaginary point in the sky called the 'equant' from where the speed could be seen to be steady and circular.

185,"kepler's second major work to be published at linz, the 'epitome of copernican astronomy' (1618-21), intended by the author as an introduction to copernican astronomy, is in fact a summary of kepler's entire work in theoretical astronomy, and describes a solar system essentially the same as the one we know today."
