72,"a man's liberal and conservative phases seem to follow each other in a succession of waves from the time he is born. children are radicals. youths are conservatives, with a dash of criminal negligence. men in their prime are liberals (as long as their digestion keeps pace with their intellect). the middle aged run to shelter: they insure their life, draft a will, accumulate mementos and occasional tables, and hope for security. and then comes old age, which repeats childhood -- a time full of humors and sadness, but often full of courage and even prophecy."

139,"“sociologically, politically, psychologically, spiritually, it was never enough for him [james baldwin] to categorize himself as one thing or the other: not just black, not just sexual, not just american, nor even just as a world-class literary artist. he embraced the whole of life the way the sun’s gravitational passion embraces everything from the smallest wandering comet to the largest looming planet. he both confronted and cultivated creative vision with a drive, passion, and brilliance that few have matched, and simply being able to watch his genius sparkle from one sentence to the next could generate both awe and revelation.”"

(it may not be as cozy an attitude as it sounds.) he greets with enthusiasm the fact of the journey, as a dog greets a man's invitation to take a walk. and he acts in the dog's way too, swinging wide, racing ahead, doubling back, covering many miles of territory that the man never traverses, all in the spirit of inquiry and the zest for truth. he leaves a crazy trail, but he ranges far beyond the genteel old party he walks with and he is usually in a better position to discover a skunk."
