1687,"his first draft of 'thanatopsis\"", his major work in blank verse,  was published in the \""north american review\"" in 1817 and marked his recognition as a poet.  he was now making contacts in literary circles and on a trip to new york in 1824 was introduced to authors such as fenimore cooper . in 1825 he moved with his young family to new york and became editor the \""new york review\"". in 1826 he delivered lectures on poetry to the athenaeum society and the american academy of art. in 1827 he took an editorial job on the new york \""evening post\"" and two years later became part owner and editor-in-chief.  his first major crusade was in support of free trade, and he also attacked the united states bank as an instrument of rich industrialists operating at the expense of  workers.  another collection of his poems came out in 1832.  after a trip through illinois he wrote \""the prairies\"" and poems about native americans. bryant first visited europe in 1834. at heidelberg he met longfellow who was studying there and the two poets took nature walks together.  in 1836 he reluctantly returned to new york and when he returned to active editorial work on the \""post\"" in 1837 he began a campaign to open up the debate for the abolition of slavery. he also wrote against the annexation of texas on the grounds that it would add to the slave states. in 1842 the english novelist dickens visited new york. the two men did not take to each other (bryant found dickens flamboyant and dickens thought bryant rather serious) but bryant, together with other literary figures such as fenimore cooper and washington irving,  actively supported dickens' campaign for international copyright law."
