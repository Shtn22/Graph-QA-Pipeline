19,this suggests that by 1438 gutenberg and dritzehen had in all probability already invented a printing process using moveable type (separate pieces of wood or metal for each letter of the alphabet).
20,"previously books had been printed by carving out each page individually on a wood block, which meant that only the very wealthy were able to afford them, and although experiments with moveable type were made in wood during the late 14th and early 15th centuries, the wood-carvers had not been able to produce small type precise enough for book work."

33,two years later fust invested more and became gutenberg's partner.
34,"the evidence for this is a five-year agreement he made in 1438 with three strasbourg men - hans riffe, andres heilmann and andres dritzehen - which indicates that by this date gutenberg had invented a new technological process (in all probability his prototype printing press) and agreed to teach it to his three partners in return for a fee and large loans."
35,"gutenberg was ordered to repay fust's first loan, with compound interest, which he was unable to do, and so fust took over the press, type and the almost-completed bibles in settlement of the debt."
36,"it is  probable, but not certain, that gutenberg learned precision metalwork at the mainz mint, where as a youth he would have seen the complex processes involved in producing coinage, which involved the careful and accurate casting and stamping of gold, an understanding of metals and temperature, and a knowledge of the use of casting chambers, dies and presses."

43,"the psalter was reprinted again and again, using the same type, until 1516, and fust and schoeffer were the first printers to adopt the practice, which later became standard, of storing set type for future editions to save the expense of resetting."
44,"he made sure to employ gutenberg's foreman, peter schoeffer, and several other of his workers, and with this team continued to print, publishing the bible in 1456, and then in august 1457, the first printed book in europe to carry both name of its printer (fust and schoeffer) and the date:-  the magnificent psalter (book of psalms)."

46,he died three years later.
47,"the agreement with riffe and heilmann came to an end in 1443, by which time it is assumed (on the basis of the existence of a scrap of paper with eleven printed lines on each side, dated to 1442, which is the oldest example of european printing from moveable type) that gutenberg had had begun printing."

52,"the partnership agreement ended in 1443, and by 1450 gutenberg was back in mainz borrowing money from goldsmith and financier johann fust to set up a new press, with the printing tools and equipment acting as security."
53,"using paper he had made from cloth rags and vellum sheets, gutenberg set about printing his bible, which may have begun as early as 1450 (but more probably in 1452)."

58,"he lost the suit, but the trial revealed that gutenberg was working on a new invention, and that some of the money advanced by dritzehen had been used to buy lead and other metals, a wooden press, and some printing materials."

60,"it has been estimated that two pages of gutenberg's bible would have needed about six thousand pieces of type, all of which had to be exactly the same depth to produce uniform print."
61,"individual type meant that each letter was interchangeable, and so after a page had been printed, the type could be disassembled and used again, but many thousands of characters - letters, punctuation marks, and blank pieces of type for the spaces - were needed for a few pages of a book."

65,gutenberg developed a method by which his type could be produced individually by punching and engraving a steel character (i.e. letter shape) into a piece of copper to form a mold which he then filled with molten lead.
66,"if this is correct, then he must clearly have discovered a quick and easy method of making type."

69,"meanwhile, fust had gained control of the type for the bible and for gutenberg's other masterpiece, an edition of the psalter, and most of gutenberg's printing equipment."
70,"meanwhile, gutenberg had at last perfected his method of casting type sufficiently to set about printing his chosen text, the bible, probably starting work on this enormous project in 1452."
71,"this work, now known as the gutenberg bible, is regarded as the first major book to come from a printing press."

85,"the invention consisted of:-   a mold with punch-stamped matrices (metal prisms used to mold the face of the type) with which type could be cast precisely and in large quantities, a type-metal alloy, a specially-designed press (based on those used in wine making, papermaking, and bookbinding), and an oil-based printing ink."

87,"meanwhile, it appears that during the late 1450s gutenberg was able to establish a print-shop but all that is known for certain of gutenberg's last years is that in january 1465 he received a pension from the archbishop of mainz, as a distinguished citizen of mainz, and was given an annual measure of grain, wine, and clothing and exempted from certain taxes."
88,"johann gutenberg was born c. 1397 at mainz (on the river rhine in germany) famous for jewel accessories,  metal-polishing, gold and silverwork."
