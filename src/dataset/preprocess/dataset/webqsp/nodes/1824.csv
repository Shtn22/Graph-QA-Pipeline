534,"pull the string, and it will follow wherever you wish. push it, and it will go nowhere at all."
535,"the worst to be feared and the best to be expected can be simply stated. the worst is atomic war. the best would be this: a life of perpetual fear and tension; a burden of arms draining the wealth and the labor of all peoples; a wasting of strength that defies the american system or the soviet system or any system to achieve true abundance and happiness for the peoples of this earth. every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. this world in arms is not spending money alone. it is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. the cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. it is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. it is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. it is some 50 miles of concrete highway. we pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. we pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. this, i repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. this is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron."

563,the emergence of this new world poses a vital issue: will outer space be preserved for peaceful use and developed for the benefit of all mankind? or will it become another focus for the arms raceand thus an area of dangerous and sterile competition? the choice is urgent. and it is ours to make. the nations of the world have recently united in declaring the continent of antarctica off limits to military preparations. we could extend this principle to an even more important sphere. national vested interests have not yet been developed in space or in celestial bodies. barriers to agreement are now lower than they will ever be again.
