1266,"[1. ] the era of appeasement must come to an end. the political and social demands that dissidents are making of the universities do not flow from sound basic educational criteria, but from strategic considerations on how to radicalize the student body, polarize the campus and extend the privileged enclaves of student power. [2. ] a concise and clear set of rules for campus conduct should be established, transmitted to incoming freshmen, and enforcedwith immediate expulsion the penalty for serious violations. [3. ] it is folly for universities confronted with their current crisis in our turbulent times to open their doors to thousands of patently unqualified students. [4. ] no negotiations under threat or coercion. [5. ] no amnesty for lawlessness or violence. [6. ] any organization which publicly declares its intention to violate the rules of an academic community and which carries out that declaration should be barred from campus. [7. ] we must look to how we are raising our children. [8. ] we must look to the university that receives those children. is it prepared to deal with the challenge of the nondemocratic left?[9. ] let us support those courageous administrators, professors and students on our college campuses who are standing up for the traditional rights of the academic community."
