171,the hypothesis led him to express relative atomic weights of elements in multiples of the weight of one element -- hydrogen (the lightest known element) -- and then to calculate a table of relative weights.
172,"he became convinced that the nature of mixed gases could be understood only by reference to atoms, and decided to use atomic weight as a practicable way of comparing individual atoms, theorizing that these weights should be evident from the relative weights of the elements that combine into well- known chemical compounds."
