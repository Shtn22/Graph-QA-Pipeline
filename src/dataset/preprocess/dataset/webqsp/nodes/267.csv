99,"and when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. verily i say unto you, they have their reward. but thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy father which is in secret; and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. but when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. be not ye therefore like unto them: for your father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. after this manner therefore pray ye: our father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come. thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.  give us this day our daily bread. and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil."
