563,the best doctor is the one you run to and can't find.
564,i have noticed that doctors who fail in the practice of medicine have a tendency to seek one another's company and aid in consultation. a doctor who cannot take out your appendix properly will recommend you to a doctor who will be unable to remove your tonsils with success.
