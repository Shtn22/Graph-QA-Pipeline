565,"“when reading about what may be described as the lesser celebrated heroic figures of the harlem renaissance, we rarely get a definitive look at just how complicated and sometimes dangerous their everyday lives were. in fact, until the past ten years, many defined the period primarily by its well-known literary, musical, and artistic elements while overlooking the fact there was any political component to it at all.”"

567,"“the united nations and the organization of american states have named 2011 as the international year for people of african descent. this is an opportunity for all of us around the globe to celebrate the diversity of our societies and to honor the contributions that our fellow citizens of african descent make every day to the economic, social and political fabrics of our communities.”"
