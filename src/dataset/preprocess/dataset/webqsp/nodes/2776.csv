0,"during this vienna period (1907-13), hitler read a great deal and absorbed many of the anti-semitic, anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideas then common in austria,  spread by, amongst others, the defrocked monk, lanz von liebenfels (whose theory of \""theozoology\"" divided humanity into two groups - aryan supermen and animal subhumans), and the austrian pan-german leader, georg von schoenerer."
1,"from these and other sources, the young hitler began to construct a vision of the world in which jews (by race, rather than by religion) became the symbol and cause of all chaos, corruption, and destruction in culture, politics and the economy, and that the press, prostitution, syphilis, capitalism, marxism, democracy and pacificism were all means exploited by 'the jew' in his conspiracy to undermine the german nation and the purity of the creative aryan race."
