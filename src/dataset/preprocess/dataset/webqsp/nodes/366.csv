591,"in 1887 nansen presented a condensed version of his ground-breaking article \""the structure and combination of the histological elements of the central nervous system\"" for his ph.d. in christiania. with academic recognition secured, nansen was ready to realize his dream of skiing across greenland. nansen first conceived of crossing greenland on skis in 1884. with monetary support from a danish beneficiary, nansen and five companions set off in may 1888. conditions were so harsh that it took nearly a month to reach the coast of greenland. in october, the men accomplished their goal.  upon reaching home, nansen was a hero. nansen had confirmed his techniques on arctic exploration and had contributed to the knowledge of greenland's interior. nansen, now a recognized expert on the arctic world, wrote the best seller: 'furthest north' and lectured throughout europe while preparing for an expedition to the north pole. he fell in love with and married eva sars, a woman who shared his passion for skiing. nansen presented the plan for his polar expedition to the norwegian geographical society, and by 1892, had secured the money for his expenses. nansen helped design a ship that he named fram (meaning 'forward') because it was designed to yield to ice pressure and not be crushed. nansen sailed from christiania on june 24, 1893. the voyage began well enough outside a few brawls and nansen's extreme mood swings. however, the trip to the pole was slower than expected, and after nearly two years the ship had barely cleared the eightieth parallel. nansen decided to put his reserve plan in motion and abandoning the fram to make the rest of the journey on foot with a single companion. conditions were dangerous. the northern-most extreme of the trip was 86 degrees 14 minutes n - not as far as nansen desired, but a record nonetheless. nansen had travelled 700 miles since leaving the fram. arriving in franz josef land, he had accomplished the first successful journey across the polar pack - again redefining arctic travel. the crew of the fram and nansen reunited in tromso. on september 9, 1896 he returned home nansen exploited his fame as much as possible. though his record was broken five years later by the explorer luigi amadeo, he was still considered the expert on arctic travel. he founded a school and turned christiania into a prime supplier of his pioneering equipment. starting in 1933, nansen sledges were probably used by the antarctic explorer, ronne. polar explorers frequently met with nansen before their expeditions. one such pilgrim was rf scott, the appointed leader of the forthcoming british antarctic expedition. another, with whom nansen was highly impressed, amundsen, who later was the first to navigate the north-west passage through the canadian arctic. in 1907, nansen was approached by shackleton, who sought his advice on his planned expedition to the south pole. nansen's greatest scientific accomplishment resulting from the fram was his observation that sea drift did not follow the wind,  but diverged in an angle. the swedish physicist ekman gave nansen's reasoning mathematical proof in what has become known as the ekman spiral. nansen's observations led to the formulation of the theory of continental drift in the early 1900's by the oceanographer, wegener."
