207,"hobbes offended the royalists who accused him of atheism and not resisting oliver cromwell, and the parliamentarians who distrusted his enthusiasm for absolute monarchy and his connections with royalists."
208,"hobbes disliked both catholics who believed papal authority exceeded that of a country's secular government, and puritans who believed their interpretations of god or the bible took precedence over the sovereign,  so he provided justification for both a monarchy and a protectorate."
209,"he discussed the legitimate basis of government, the subject's right to resist, the status of the law and the position of the church."
