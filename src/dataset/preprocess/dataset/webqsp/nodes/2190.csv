7,"at the protestant university of tÿbingen  kepler studied theology, philosophy, and mathematics (under the astronomer maestlin, who introduced him to copernicus' work.   kepler intended to become a lutheran minister, and after graduating in 1591, started a three-year programme of theological training. kepler's theological studies were interrupted in 1594, when he was nominated by his tutors for a teaching post in mathematics and astronomy at the academy in graz (now in austria)  where he stayed for four years, and began to concentrate on both astrology (he remained a believer in astrology until his death) and astronomy, working with maestlin on optics and planetary orbits."

112,"according to ptolemy, this model provided the basis for mathematical computations that would explain all the strange things astronomers observed, such as the way the brightness of the planets waxed and waned, and the way in which they appeared to stop moving, or go backwards and forwards in a loop (like mars)."
113,the speed of the planetary movements also seemed to vary and ptolemy dealt with this anomaly by creating an imaginary point in the sky called the 'equant' from where the speed could be seen to be steady and circular.
