52,"the legislative job of the president is especially important to the people who have no special representatives to plead their cause before congressand that includes the great majority. i sometimes express it by saying the president is the only lobbyist that one hundred and fifty million americans have. the other twenty million are able to employ people to represent themand thats all right, its the exercise of the right of petitionbut someone has to look after the interests of the one hundred and fifty million that are left."
