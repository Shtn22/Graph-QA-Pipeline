259,rutherford's explanation of radioactivity at the atomic level caused a sensation in scientific circles: the idea that  atoms could change their identity was revolutionary.
260,this work would earn rutherford the 1908 nobel prize in  chemistry.
261,"thomson did find some detractors, however, including the german physicist lenard , who for a period bitterly claimed priority over the discovery, and by a few scientists such as the german chemist ostwald , who until his death in 1932 refused to believe in the existence of either atoms or electrons."
262,"over the next few years thomson also developed a model of the atom that incorporated his discovery, sometimes referred to as the \""plum pudding\"" atom, in which he proposed that the atom is a diffuse sphere of positive electrical charge in which discrete, negatively-charged electrons are embedded."

641,"the most important aspect of the bohr liquid-drop model was its later ability to explain the process of nuclear fission (the splitting of a heavy nucleus into two parts, almost equal in mass, following the absorption of a neutron, with the release of a tremendous amount of nuclear energy), discovered in 1938 by otto hahn,  fritz strassmann and lise meitner."
642,the liquid-drop model was vindicated when bohr correctly predicted that the differing behavior of the nuclei of uranium-235 and uranium-238 was due to the fact that the number of neutrons in each nucleus was odd and even respectively.
