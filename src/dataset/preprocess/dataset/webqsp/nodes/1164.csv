135,"“sociologically, politically, psychologically, spiritually, it was never enough for him [james baldwin] to categorize himself as one thing or the other: not just black, not just sexual, not just american, nor even just as a world-class literary artist. he embraced the whole of life the way the sun’s gravitational passion embraces everything from the smallest wandering comet to the largest looming planet. he both confronted and cultivated creative vision with a drive, passion, and brilliance that few have matched, and simply being able to watch his genius sparkle from one sentence to the next could generate both awe and revelation.”"
