38,hooke was perhaps the greatest experimental scientist of the seventeenth century.
39,"in his two publications of 1661, 'certain physiological essays' and 'the sceptical chymist', boyle's first aim was to disprove the old theory of the 'four elements': earth, air, fire, and water, as well as the 'three principles': salt, sulphur, and mercury, and to put a mechanical theory of matter in their place."
