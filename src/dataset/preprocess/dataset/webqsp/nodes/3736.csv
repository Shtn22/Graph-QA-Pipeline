53,schwann's theory of the cell as the common unit of all animal structure established the modern science of histology.
54,"he succeeded in measuring the differing length of a muscle as it contracted under stimulus with a variety of loads, and was also able to compare the intensity of its contraction with that of the stimulus causing it to contract."
