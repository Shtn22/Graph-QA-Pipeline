19,"in february 1898 curie discovered (at the same time as g.c. schmidt) that, of the elements, only thorium and uranium (which she had obtained from the chemist moissan) emit radiation, but she was then startled to discover that the ores pitchblende and chalcolite had much greater levels of radioactivity than the amounts of uranium and thorium (that  they contained) could account for."
20,"during the first year of her research, curie coined the term \""radioactivity\"" to describe this mysterious force."

23,both new elements were much more radioactive than either uranium or thorium.
24,"working on samples of radium was a huge task, as two tons of pitchblende ore (in the form of waste from a polish uranium mine) had to be processed in order to obtain a few centigrams of pure radium."
