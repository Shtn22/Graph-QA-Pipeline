637,"as a principle-centered person you try to stand apart from the emotion of the situation and from other factors that would act on you, and evaluate the options. looking at the balanced whole--the work needs, the family needs, the other needs that may be involved, and the possible implications of the various alternatives -- you'll try to come up with the best solution taking all factors into consideration. we are limited but we can push back the borders of our limitations."

814,"“the act of writing itself is much like the construction of a mirror made of words. looking at certain illuminated corners of or cracks within the mirror, the author can see fragments of an objective reality that comprise the physical universe, social communities, political dynamics, and other facets of human existence. looking in certain other corners of the same mirror, he or she may experience glimpses of a true self sheltered deftly behind a mask of public proprieties.”"
