227,"“sociologically, politically, psychologically, spiritually, it was never enough for him [james baldwin] to categorize himself as one thing or the other: not just black, not just sexual, not just american, nor even just as a world-class literary artist. he embraced the whole of life the way the sun’s gravitational passion embraces everything from the smallest wandering comet to the largest looming planet. he both confronted and cultivated creative vision with a drive, passion, and brilliance that few have matched, and simply being able to watch his genius sparkle from one sentence to the next could generate both awe and revelation.”"

271,"very little in science fiction can transcend the gimmickry of a technical conceit, yet without that conceit at its heart a book is not truly science fiction. furthermore, so little emerging thought and technology is employed by sf writers today that the genre is lagging far behind reality both in the cosmology area and the technology area: sf is no longer a place to experiment, but is now very derivative."

405,"“the act of writing itself is much like the construction of a mirror made of words. looking at certain illuminated corners of or cracks within the mirror, the author can see fragments of an objective reality that comprise the physical universe, social communities, political dynamics, and other facets of human existence. looking in certain other corners of the same mirror, he or she may experience glimpses of a true self sheltered deftly behind a mask of public proprieties.”"
